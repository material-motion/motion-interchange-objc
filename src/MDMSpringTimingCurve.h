 specify how fast the object at the end of the simulated spring was moving before it was attached.
 It's a unit coordinate system, where 1 is defined as travelling the total animation distance in a
 second. So if you're changing an object's position by 200pt in this animation, and you want the
 animation to behave as if the object was moving at 100pt/s before the animation started, you'd
 pass 0.5. You'll typically want to pass 0 for the velocity."
